This section focuses on ArrayList, a dynamic array implementation in Java that provides flexibility in managing collections of objects.

Definition and Features: Explained ArrayList as part of the Java Collections Framework, emphasizing its dynamic resizing capability and ease of use for managing variable-length lists.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations such as adding, removing, and accessing elements, along with methods for searching and sorting.

Performance Considerations: Discussed the time complexity of common operations, noting that ArrayList offers O(1) time for access but O(n) for insertions and deletions (except at the end).

Use Cases: Provided examples of practical use cases, such as storing lists of user inputs, managing collections of data, and implementing dynamic data structures.

Best Practices: Highlighted best practices for using ArrayList effectively, including initial capacity setting to reduce resizing overhead and utilizing generics for type safety.
